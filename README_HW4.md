# Homework 4 

## Overview

This repository contains the files for Homework 4 of the BioStat course by Bondareva Alina. The primary content includes an R Markdown file (`HW4 BioStat Bondareva Alina Kirillovna.Rmd`) and the corresponding HTML report (`HW4-BioStat-Bondareva-Alina-Kirillovna.html`). This README provides a detailed guide on the contents, structure, and usage of these files.

## Files

### 1. `HW4 BioStat Bondareva Alina Kirillovna.Rmd`

This R Markdown file contains the R code and markdown text used to generate the HTML report. The file is structured into several sections, each addressing different aspects of the statistical analysis.

#### Sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - Provides an overview of the homework and the objectives of the analysis.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Contains R code for loading and preprocessing the dataset, including steps such as data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Includes summary statistics and visualizations to describe the data.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Conducts various statistical tests to validate hypotheses.

5. **Regression Analysis**
   - Performs regression analysis to model relationships between variables.

6. **Discussion and Conclusion**
   - Summarizes the findings and discusses their implications.

### 2. `HW4-BioStat-Bondareva-Alina-Kirillovna.html`

This is the HTML report generated from the R Markdown file. It contains all the analyses, visualizations, and textual explanations in a readable format.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

To run the R Markdown file and generate the HTML report, you need the following software and packages installed:

- R (version 4.0 or later)
- RStudio (recommended)
- R packages: `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and other relevant packages for statistical analysis.

### Steps to Generate the HTML Report

1. **Open RStudio**
   - Launch RStudio and open the `HW4 BioStat Bondareva Alina Kirillovna.Rmd` file.

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - Ensure that all required packages are installed. You can install them using the following command in the R console:
     ```R
     install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
     ```

3. **Knit the Document**
   - Click the "Knit" button in RStudio to generate the HTML report from the R Markdown file. This will execute the R code chunks and create the output file `HW4-BioStat-Bondareva-Alina-Kirillovna.html`.

### Viewing the HTML Report

- Open the `HW4-BioStat-Bondareva-Alina-Kirillovna.html` file in any web browser to view the analysis results, visualizations, and conclusions.
